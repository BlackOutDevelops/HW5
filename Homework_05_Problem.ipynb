As domestrated below, in this game, the treasure (denoted by T) is on the right-most and the explorer (denoted by o) will learn to get the treasure by moving left and right. The explorer will be rewarded when it gets the treasure.  After serveral epoches, the explorer will learn how to get the treasure faster and finally it will go to the treasure by moving to right directly. \\\n","\n","Episode 1, Step1: o----T   \\\n","... \\\n","Episode 1, Step6: ---o-T   \\\n","... \\\n","Episode 1, Step10: -o---T \\\n","... \\\n","Episode 1, Step15: ----oT (finished) \\\n","\n","You will use **\"Tasks\"** and **\"Hints\"** to finish the work. **(Total 100 Points)** \\\n","\n","**Task Overview:**\n","- Train the explorer getting the treasure quickly through Q-learning method"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"p0Cmvbnj7REa"},"source":["## 1 Achieve Q-learning method ##\n","### 1.1 Model Preparation**(5 Points)**\n","\n","Import useful packages and prepare hyperpaprameters for Q-learning methods. \n","\n","**Tasks:**\n","1.

We introduce ε-greedy (In lecture slide 16, page 35). In the initial exploring stage, the explorer knows little about the environment. Therefore, it is better to explore randomly instead of greedy. ε-greedy is the value to control the degree of greedy. It can be changed with time lapsing. In this homework, we set it as fixed value EPSILON = 0.9. You can change it to explore the final effect.\n","\n","**Tasks:**\n","1. define the choose_action function\n","2. **Print Out** sample action.\n","\n","**Hints:**\n","1.
